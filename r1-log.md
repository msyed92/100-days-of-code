## Log

### R1D1
Worked on projects from Jose Portilla's list:
[Find n digits of Pi](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/digits_of_pi.py)
[Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/collatz.py)
[Pig Latin](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/pig_latin.py)

I decided to extend the Pig Latin translator and not just translate one word, but translate a phrase and then return a string with correct puncutation and spacing. Still working on it.


### R1D2
Continued with projects on the list. Tried to build a [file transfer program](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects/Day_2/pythonFTP). Although I was able to follow a tutorial on YouTube, didn't fully understand. Decided to work on [Happy Numbers](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_2/happynumbers.py).
