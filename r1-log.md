# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Manaal Syed

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 16, Monday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1
Worked on projects from Jose Portilla's list:
[Find n digits of Pi](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/digits_of_pi.py)
[Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/collatz.py)
[Pig Latin](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/pig_latin.py)

I decided to extend the Pig Latin translator and not just translate one word, but translate a phrase and then return a string with correct puncutation and spacing. Still working on it.


### R1D2
Continued with projects on the list. Tried to build a [file transfer program](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects/Day_2/pythonFTP). Although I was able to follow a tutorial on YouTube, didn't fully understand. Decided to work on [Happy Numbers](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_2/happynumbers.py).

### R1D3

Reviewing HTML basics and have a skeleton for a resume website. Really simple, but I want to include it to show progress.

### R1D7-10
Review Bootstrap and made another portfolio site that is responsive. Not all the links are functional as the purpose of this was mostly to practice CSS and Bootstrap styling:

### R1D11
Reviewed Javascript! Straightforward for now. Haven't gotten to implementing in scripts yet.

### R1D12
More review of Javascript. Got to adding it to html files and interacting with CSS.

### R1D13
More review of Javascript, learned about event listeners, animation, and playing sounds. Won't upload code since I just followed along with the tutorial. Will practice on my own tomorrow.

### R1D14

Practicing by making projects from John Smilga's Vanilla JS projects. Making a color flipper, will include code when finished.
