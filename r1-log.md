The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 16, Monday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1
Worked on projects from Jose Portilla's list:
[Find n digits of Pi](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/digits_of_pi.py)
[Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/collatz.py)
[Pig Latin](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_1/pig_latin.py)

I decided to extend the Pig Latin translator and not just translate one word, but translate a phrase and then return a string with correct puncutation and spacing. Still working on it.


### R1D2
Continued with projects on the list. Tried to build a [file transfer program](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects/Day_2/pythonFTP). Although I was able to follow a tutorial on YouTube, didn't fully understand. Decided to work on [Happy Numbers](https://github.com/msyed92/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Projects/Day_2/happynumbers.py).

### R1D3

Reviewing HTML basics and have a skeleton for a resume website. Really simple, but I want to include it to show progress.

### R1D11
Reviewed Javascript! Straightforward for now. Haven't gotten to implementing in scripts yet.

### R1D12
More review of Javascript. Got to adding it to html files and interacting with CSS.

### R1D13
More review of Javascript, learned about event listeners, animation, and playing sounds. Won't upload code since I just followed along with the tutorial. Will practice on my own tomorrow.

### R1D14

Practicing by making projects from John Smilga's Vanilla JS projects. Making a color flipper, will include code when finished.
Got back to it later in the day and completed the color flipper! Included both the simple version (just flips between basic colors) and a hex version, which flips through a randomly generated hex code color. Here it is" [Color Flipper](https://msyed92.github.io/color_flipper/)

### R1D15

Made another project from John Smilga's list. Simple counter with color change.
[Counter](https://msyed92.github.io/counter/)

### R1D16-18

Day 16: Working on a basic carousel. Just did the structure and the CSS. Haven't gotten to the functionality yet.
Day 17: Completed the funtionality
Day 18: Tidied up the styling, and improve the script so it included objects and functions.

### R1D19

Learned about jQUery and started a basic SIMON game challenge in the Udemy course. Not uploading the code since it's from a tutorial.

### R1D20-23

Practicing javascript by making a responsive navbar. Will upload when finished.

Completed. Got the functionality to work, perhaps the styling could be improved. But this was done without tutorials just me trying things out and a little bit of Googling for small pieces of the code. Going to check out the tutorial for this tomorrow because there has to be a better/cleaner way.

### R1D24

Watched the video on how to make the navbar, applied what I learned to make a sidebar. Got the functionality, once I improve the CSS I'll upload the code. Finding CSS way harder than Javascript.

### R1D25

Worked on fixing some of the styling and functionality for the sidebar. Having a lot of issues getting it to work with resizing windows, and hiding some of the buttons when the sidebar is open. Will fix soon.

### R1D27

Continued the Web Dev Bootcamp course on Udemy. Learned about Nodejs and basics of backend.

### R1D28

Learned about Express with Node, while it was very easy to understand I think I want to learn how to build things with just Node first, and then add Express on afterwards. Going to go on YouTube to learn.

### R1D29-35

Reviewed Javascript basics on freeCodeCamp. Lot of it was review, some new thigns (object notation). Going to complete this course before I continue with learning Node. After learning Node, I'll continue with the Udemy course. Want to be thorough.

Reviewed regex, debugging, some practice with algorithms, and more on data structures.

Continued the fCC course, Intermediate Algorithm scripting...challenging but fun!

Almost done with the fCC javascript course. one more problemt left.

worked on the projects!

### R1D36-37

John Smilga's Nodejs tutorials on YouTube.
